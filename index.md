## Description

A fun memory game for all ages. It has varying difficulties, which range from 6 to 32 pairs of cute animals, accompanied with respective sounds.
Suitable for toddlers, but you can have fun and be challenged as well.

This game was developed for my 1 year old niece. Now she is 2 years old, and we had quite some fun with it. At first it was fun for her to hear different animal sounds. Later on she started recognizing different animals, and started matching up the pairs. 
In the beginning game had only the easiest mode - 6 pairs. Now, however, 6 pairs is just too easy for her, so it was time for something more challenging. That inspired me to enrich this game with some more difficulty levels. 
It now even has a timed mode, so some of us adults can have fun and get challenged as well.
My niece at the moment is playing with 8 pairs, which are a decent challenge at this point - and she is still having fun, proudly raising her hands up when she matches 2 animals and stating something like: "Doggy is gone!". Ofcourse, sound is still always on.

Hope you and your youngest will have fun and enjoy this game as much as we did!
